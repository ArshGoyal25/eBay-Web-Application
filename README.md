# eBay-Web-Application-iOS

Constructed a Search Engine to pull real time information on items listed on eBay using eBay Developer APIs. 
Incorporated MongoDB to persist items added in wishlist, Google Custom Search Engine to find images related to product, and IpInfo/ Geo Names API to get user's location and pincode suggestions.
This App was created using the MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express.JS, AngularJS and NodeJS) and later developed as an Mobile iOS Application using Swift UI.
