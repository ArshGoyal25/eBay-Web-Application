# eBay-Web-Application

Constructed a Search Engine to pull real-time information on items listed on eBay using eBay Developer APIs. 
Incorporated MongoDB to persist items added in wishlist, Google Custom Search Engine to find images related to the product, and IpInfo/ Geo Names API to get user's location and pincode suggestions.
This App was created using the MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express.JS, AngularJS, and NodeJS) and later developed as a Mobile iOS Application using Swift UI.
The Web Application has been hosted on Google Cloud and AWS.
